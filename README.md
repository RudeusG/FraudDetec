Fraud Detection with unsupervised Clustering<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**Overview**<br/>
Using *k-means algorithm* we train a classifier only on legit transactions <br />
Fraud transactions are detected,then, when they can't conform to recognized patterns<br />
Two models have been made; one using all feature vectors and one using only feature vectors exhibiting different data distributions <br/>
**Using all available data; version 1.0**<br/>
